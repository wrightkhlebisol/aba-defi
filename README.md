DeFi App that provides liquidity pool to a token

## Brief/Background
Create a DeFi app that provides a liquidity pool to a token.


## Instructions:



## SmartContract:
Create a custom ERC20 token. You can name the token ABC or other name as you please

Create a liquidity pool and calculate an APR of 15% for staking the ABC token in a liquidity pool

When a user stakes ABC, a new token should be minted called cABC

Calculate an APR anytime the user loads the view 

This can be deployed to the Ethereum testnet - e.g: Rinkeby, Robsten etc.


## Simple React app (form and button, no design needed):

User should be able to login with metamask.﻿
App functionality:

### Buttons

Buy token: This will add ABC tokens to the user's wallet ﻿

Provide liquidity: This will allow the user to send the purchased token to the liquidity pool

### View
